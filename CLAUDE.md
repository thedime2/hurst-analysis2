# Claude Code Project Instructions: Hurst Spectral Analysis

## Project Purpose

This is a **research project** to faithfully reproduce, understand, validate, and extend the spectral market analysis framework developed by **J.M. Hurst** in *The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing*.

**Primary focus**: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), specifically:
- Appendix A (Figures AI-1 through AI-6)
- Page 152 six-filter decomposition
- Derivation of the Nominal Model

**Philosophy**: **Reproduce first, understand second, extend third**

This is NOT a trading system or optimization exercise. It is a systematic attempt to verify Hurst's methodology before extending it with modern tools.

## Key Technical Conventions

### Frequency Units
- **All frequencies in radians per year (ω)**
- Conversion: `ω (rad/year) = ω (rad/week) × 52`
- Period: `T (years) = 2π / ω`

### Data Assumptions
- **Weekly spacing**: 52 data points per year
- **Primary time range**: 1921-04-29 to 1965-05-21 (matches Hurst's analysis window)
- **Data source**: stooq.com (cached locally in `data/raw/`)
- **No price adjustments**: Analysis uses raw Close prices as loaded

### Spectral Method
- **Fourier-Lanczos spectrum** (not standard FFT)
- Implemented in [src/spectral/lanczos.py](src/spectral/lanczos.py)
- Returns: `w, wRad, cosprt, sinprt, amp, phRad, phGrad`

---

## Important Technical Notes

### Lanczos Resolution Discrepancy
The Lanczos spectrum implementation includes a detailed replication note (see [src/spectral/lanczos.py](src/spectral/lanczos.py) docstring).

**Summary**: Hurst's text states 2229 data points with 0.568 rad/year resolution, but empirical evidence shows the spectrum must have been computed over the **full ~44-year record** (~2297 samples) with actual resolution ~0.14 rad/year. This is consistent with:
- Low-frequency content in Figure AI-1
- Fine frequency spacing at ~0.3676 rad/year
- Subsequent Nominal Model derivation

This is interpreted as an **editorial error**, not a methodological one. Fine spectral structure is inferred through envelope curvature, trough regularity, and overlapping comb filter validation, not from discrete Fourier bin spacing alone.

### "Meaningless Frequencies"
The PRD and Hurst's work mention certain frequencies as "meaningless" - these are NOT errors but hypotheses to test:
- May arise from beating between closely-spaced lines
- May represent filter mismatch artifacts
- May indicate sidebands of amplitude modulation

Do NOT dismiss or filter these until the hypothesis is tested in Phase 2-3.

| Element | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Filter decomposition | `filter_decomposition.png` | Page 152 structural decomposition into 6 filters |

**Key Reference Points:**
- Low-pass and band-pass filter specifications
- Frequency ranges and filter responses
- Reconstruction accuracy and energy conservation

## Using Reference Materials in Development

**When reproducing Phase N figures:**
1. Open the corresponding reference figure from `references/`
2. Compare your generated figure visually and numerically
3. Document any differences in code comments
4. If discrepancies exist, investigate:
   - Data source differences (we use modern stooq data)
   - Methodological interpretation
   - Parameter values and assumptions

**Example comparison:**
```python
# Phase 1: Figure AI-1 Reproduction
# Reference: references/appendix_a/figure_AI1.png
# Our reproduction: experiments/appendix_A/figure_AI1_reproduction.png
#
# Comparison notes:
# - Envelope fits well to data
# - Fine structure visible at ~0.73 rad/year spacing (vs Hurst's 0.3676)
# - May indicate different data period or sampling
```

---

## Coding Conventions

### Style
- Follow existing code style in [src/spectral/lanczos.py](src/spectral/lanczos.py)
- Use numpy for array operations
- Docstrings should reference Hurst's book and page numbers where relevant
- Comment any deviations from Hurst's methodology

### Naming
- Use `omega` or `w` for frequency in radians
- Use `amp` for amplitude
- Use `dataspacing` for sample interval
- Use `datapointsperyr` for sampling rate (typically 52 for weekly)

### Function Signatures
- Return multiple values as tuples (following lanczos_spectrum pattern)
- Accept numpy arrays, not lists
- Use keyword arguments with defaults for optional parameters

### Documentation
- Every reproduction script should have:
  - Header comment stating which figure/analysis it reproduces
  - Data range used
  - Key assumptions
  - Reference to Hurst's original (page number, figure number)

---

## Reproduction Requirements

When reproducing Hurst's figures:
1. **Visual match**: Generated figure should match Hurst's original in:
   - Axis ranges and scales (linear/log)
   - Peak/trough locations
   - Overall spectral envelope shape

2. **Numerical match**: Key parameters should be within 5-10% unless explained:
   - Envelope slopes
   - Peak frequencies
   - Filter center frequencies

3. **Documentation**: Any differences must be:
   - Noted in code comments
   - Explained as either:
     - Data difference (we use updated stooq data)
     - Interpretation difference (document reasoning)
     - Calculation difference (explain why)

4. **Testability**: Every claim about the spectrum should be:
   - Quantifiable (not just "looks similar")
   - Reproducible (script can be re-run)
   - Verifiable (compare to Hurst's published values)

---

## Testing and Verification

### Before Committing Code
1. Run the affected script to verify it executes without errors
2. Visually inspect output for reasonableness
3. Check that results are consistent with PRD expectations
4. Ensure no hardcoded paths (use relative paths or os.path.join)

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase is complete when:
- All deliverables match PRD specification
- Visual output matches Hurst's original figure
- Results are saved to `data/processed/`
- Script is documented and can be re-run deterministically

---

## Common Patterns

### Loading DJIA Data
```python
from src.data import getStooq
import pandas as pd

# Load weekly DJIA data
df = pd.read_csv('data/raw/^dji_w.csv')
df.Date = df.Date.apply(pd.to_datetime)

# Filter to Hurst's time window
df_hurst = df[df.Date.between('1921-04-29', '1965-05-21')]
close_prices = df_hurst.Close.values
```

### Computing Lanczos Spectrum
```python
from src.spectral import lanczos_spectrum

dataspacing = 1  # Weekly data, no gaps
datapointsperyr = 52

w, wRad, cosprt, sinprt, amp, phRad, phGrad = lanczos_spectrum(
    close_prices, dataspacing, datapointsperyr
)

# Convert to rad/year
omega_yr = w * 52
```

### Plotting Spectrum
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(omega_yr, amp, 'b.-', markersize=4)
plt.xscale('linear')
plt.yscale('log')
plt.xlim(-0.1, 22)
plt.xlabel("Angular Frequency ω (radians per year)")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude (log scaled)")
plt.title("Lanczos Spectrum – DJIA 1921–1965")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Current Development Focus

**Phase 1 Completion** (as of February 2026):
- Implementing automated peak/trough detection
- Implementing envelope fitting (a(ω) = k/ω) using least-squares regression
- Replacing hardcoded envelope slopes with fitted parameters
- Generating structured Phase 1 deliverables

**Next Step**: Implement [src/spectral/peak_detection.py](src/spectral/peak_detection.py) and [src/spectral/envelopes.py](src/spectral/envelopes.py)

## Notes for Future Sessions

- The existing test script ([experiments/appendix_A/test_lanczos_djia.py](experiments/appendix_A/test_lanczos_djia.py)) has hardcoded envelope slopes (`ktop=0.1875`, `kbot=0.0575`) that were manually estimated - these should be replaced with fitted values once envelope fitting is implemented

- When implementing Phase 2 (Ormsby filters), pay attention to the distinction between "real" and "complex" Ormsby filters - Hurst used real filters, but complex filters (with analytic envelopes) are planned for extensions

- The project uses Python 3.13+ - ensure all code is compatible
